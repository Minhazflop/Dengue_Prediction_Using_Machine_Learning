## Project Overview

Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions. Predicting outbreaks is essential for timely preventive measures. This project uses machine learning models to analyze environmental features and predict the number of dengue cases with high accuracy.

## Problem Statement

Traditional methods for forecasting dengue outbreaks are often delayed or inaccurate. There is a need for a reliable predictive model that uses environmental and climate data to anticipate dengue trends and help public health authorities prepare effectively.

## Objectives

- Analyze dengue trends and climatic influences.
- Apply machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.
- Evaluate and compare model performance.
- Provide insights to aid in dengue outbreak prevention.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes climate and dengue case data across two major cities in Brazil: San Juan and Iquitos. Key features include:

- Temperature (avg, min, max)
- Precipitation
- Humidity
- Week of the year
- Number of dengue cases


## Methodology

The following steps were followed:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data distributions and correlations.
3. **Model Building**:
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - XGBoost
   - Gradient Boosting
4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
   - RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
   - RÂ² Score

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Colab
- Microsoft Word (for documentation)

## Results and Findings

- Among the models, the Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regressors showed the best performance.
- Feature importance analysis indicated temperature and humidity as critical predictors of dengue outbreaks.

## Conclusion

Machine learning models, particularly ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, offer a powerful tool for predicting dengue outbreaks using climatic data. These models can significantly aid public health planning and resource allocation.

## Future Work

- Incorporate real-time data from health departments.
- Deploy the model as a web or mobile application.
- Integrate additional environmental factors such as urbanization or population density.
